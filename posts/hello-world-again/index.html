                <section>
            <p>First of all, I know it has been quite silent on here for a while. Since the last time I posted here, I switched jobs, and moved countries, so it would be fair to say that I have been quite busy in the meanwhile. But I’d still like to apologise, and I promise I will try to post more frequently from now on.</p>
<p>If you have been here before, you might have noticed that things have changed a fair bit. This is the new blog, reborn from the ashes, so to say. Though only because I felt like it was necessary to burn the old one. It’s now built using <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> instead of <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com">Pelican</a><span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Why switch, you ask? Shiny toys, that’s why.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, and it’s using <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> instead of my homegrown Jinja2 templates and CSS. I spent much more time on setting this up than I care to admit. The upshot is, I have new CSS without having to rewrite all my custom templates from scratch, and get to use these neat stylesheets.</p>
<p>One of my major pains with my old setup was the setup required to just write something quickly, due to the fact that I was maintaining my own styles and sources in different repositories, and also because Python requirements are notoriously janky if you’re not careful. This new system is handled entirely by <a href="https://www.stackage.org">stack</a>, which makes things much easier.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">By the way, you can get the source of this blog <a href="https://github.com/sulami/sulami.github.io">over here</a>, if you want to steal some code, or just look at it.<br />
<br />
</span></span> Initial setup takes quite a while, because I have to compile a whole load of dependencies, but it’s a fully automatic setup.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I was tempted to just switch to Medium during this whole process. But now that I have figured out how to build this whole thing<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Read: get it to compile<br />
<br />
</span></span>, I am quite happy with the results. Because Hakyll, just like Pelican, uses Markdown as source to generate HTML, I could easily port over my old posts once the dust had settled.</p>

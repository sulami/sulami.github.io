            <p><a href="https://github.com/sulami/frankenwm">FrankenWM</a> is a small, dynamic tiling window manager for Xorg. It is written purely in C and configured using a header at compile-time. It has been forked from monsterwm ages ago, and while the configuration and usage still feels a lot like monsterwm, the underlying code is almost a complete rewrite. It is also used on the asynchronous XCB library as opposed to the synchronous Xlib, which monsterwm is based on, which makes it even faster.</p>
<p>Here is a quick overview of the features it brings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tons of layouts, currently 13</li>
<li>Gaps and borders that are configurable at runtime and optionally per desktop</li>
<li>Proper minimizing using a desktop-specific client-stacks</li>
<li>Real support for floating windows, for mouse-less desktops</li>
<li>An optional scratchpad window that can be shown and hidden quickly from anywhere</li>
<li>Configurable like almost nothing else, even with regexes to control window spawning</li>
<li>Prepared for a panel of your choice by leaving configurable free space on the screen and outputting information to display on it</li>
<li>And probably more which I forgot</li>
</ul>
<p>Even other people like it (actual quotes):</p>

i spent way too much time configuring them, anyways. the only one i enjoy using is frankenwm</code></pre>
